# Train puzzle example

I saw a puzzle on the internet where identical train carriages
are connected together in a circle,
you cant mark a carriage in any way except turn the light on or off.
The goal is to determine the number of carriages
without assuming a maximum size.

The trivial solution of "turn off all lights then turn one on" doesnt work btw

train.c contains an implementation of a solution to this problem in c
